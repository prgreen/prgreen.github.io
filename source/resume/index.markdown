## Work Experience

**2011 - present, self-employed Tech Monk**

- Assembled a team of engineers to work on retro-style video game projects in Python/C/C++/Lua during their spare time.

- Coded a concurrent coroutine-based Lua framework for 2D video game programming (hardware accelerated graphics, windows, events, sprite loading, sounds, network, realistic physics) using LuaJIT's FFI (Foreign function interface) and bindings to C libraries. 

- Administered a Linux dedicated server hosting a dozen websites (Debian, NGINX, PHP-fpm, Python WSGI, gevent, WebSockets, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis). 

- Learned all recent technologies compulsively (Node.js, socket.io, MongoDB, Redis) by using them in personal projects, usually one-page realtime web apps.

**2010, Web software engineer, *Smart&Geek*, a web/mobile startup**

- Directed evolutions of a huge PHP web platform (Weavlink), both front and back ends, modernizing the look&feel, allowing Flash video integration, streamlining the sign up process, optimizing database calls, upgrading PHP version and servers.

- Took the lead on the trivia facebook app "le Défi des Prépas" as a math expert to implement the Glicko rating system(PHP/Zend Framework). This allowed a rigorous selection of 5 winners (among 1300 players) who advanced to a subsequent television show.

- Coded Python scripts to enable a big website ownership transfer (~10k files, huge database and thousands of images). 

- Developed a specialized web platform for Rouen Business School, interconnecting their CV database with our platform, to provide statistics for the school and automated customized e-portfolios for the 4200 students. 

**2009, PHP developer, *Weavlink*, a social media platform & web startup**

*Weavlink is a Facebook-like web platform connecting dozens of multinational companies with ~30,000 students from the top universities and business schools in France.*

- Developed evolutions of the platform in PHP/SQL: better integration to other social networks, event calendar, summaries and tag clouds, moderation tools.

- Consumed RSS containing job offers to integrate them into Weavlink.

- Implemented *wefolios*, giving the possibility for users to create professional configurable e-portfolios aggregating information from various social networks.

- Developed official Facebook pages for multinational companies using proprietary Facebook languages.

- Designed and implemented a registration website for the national "Semaine pour l'emploi" (Employment week), using jQuery and AJAX calls to retrieve company descriptions, in association with the French national television (*France 5*) website.


## Personal projects

- Created and managed a social PHP web platform for amateur novel writers and their readers, ~5,000 unique visitors/month, and 2 or 3 new authors every week.

- Writing a (mostly) technical blog on Math/Tech/Programming/Culture/Music.

*Note: I have French/American dual citizenship, no visa required.*
