## The Internet: the new agora

people communicating, friends, families skype

only companies and celebrities have valuable stuff to offer?

twitter from indviduals to companies

this is where the customers are

## Using a website is always a transaction

facebook, gmail, free stuff, cool!

people feel cheated when they learn that they gave more than they wanted (privacy options, ad photos).

People won't be fascinated so easily anymore: long-term viability is not in smooth talk or loud shouts (viral marketing bullshit).

## The true long-term viability of ad-supported web

where do you make your money when you're a pure player

facebook twitter introduction of ads will kill them

## New uses with better bandwidth

## The Internet as a virtual market place, the only viable future

give people what they want

explicit transaction

connected mutually beneficial, hive

## The Internet solves capitalism optimally 

no other way in a capitalist economy where obtaining money is the only way to survivei. No revolution, gamers need donations, etc.

building things(O(1)) < making others build them(O(n)) < benefit from transactions (O(2))

facebook, twitter, amazon, ebay: how many web giants connect people, both producers and consumers? All of them

ultra-rich techs vs poor masses: the internet accelerates capitalism collapse

classic dystopia: megacorp, a company exponentially efficient who ends up owning everything

# Giving power back to the people: cyborgs

horizontal society (at least for people who agree to become "connected")

offer and demand ? immediately and most efficiently met by the most local workers

meritocraty? more means means more benefits, no other factor
striving for more efficiency will become fruitless (hiring only geniuses)
