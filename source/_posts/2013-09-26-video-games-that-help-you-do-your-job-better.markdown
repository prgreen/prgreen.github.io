## Synergies between the game and the required skills

give a sens of constant progression when there is no more (wow!)

## Instant feedback on your actions help you correct them

when you don't know, you get demotivated

consequences are too removed from your actions, no positive reinforcement possible in capitalist menial jobs

put screens in kitchens where cooks see rated dishes in realtime

have visual indicators for everything

(screens with social media aggregate in start-ups!)

## Games already exist, but video games are better and cheaper

gordon ramsay 50$ bill for waitress with the most tables at the end of the service

business games, as part of hiring

sports are games too, checks viability of persons AND nation

in the same way, more games inside work means more ways to feel good collectively


video games can be very quick, need only a screen and any interaction device (simple buttons)

they can display sensor informations (or social media live)

## Impact on performance

training, job interviews

When you feel observed, you have more incentive to work

You feel motivated when you see the results of your actions

## Threats

games that distract you from the job

evaluating employees based on game results can have nefarious consequences, it must remain a game

# Serious games are not ambitious enough

They limit themselves to training, not an integral part of the job
